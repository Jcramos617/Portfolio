            <p> My name is Jordan Ramos and I'm from the Bronx, New York. I am a second-year student at Laguardia community college majoring in New Media digital journalism. I also do digital art on Tumblr with adobe programs including photoshop, illustrator, premiere, after effects and 3D animation with the program Blender. I also like to use WordPress to blog news.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am a very determined person that wants to show the world that it could be a better place. I feel blue is my color because it is a very calming color to me and shows the peacefulness of the sky especially at night. I also like green because it is the world and nature itself and it shows how beautiful Earth is. I also love 80s rock and grunge rock because it shows how the world could be free-spirited and with grunge doing the same thing, however, it has darker tones and it is really good to listen to.</p>
                <br>
            <p>I'm very inspired by dark comedians such as Dave Chappelle, George Carlin, and Richard Pryor. I also enjoy watching irrelevant movies like the Big Lebowski. I also love sci-fi including Blade Runner which is an inspiration for my artwork. The art reflects on how I feel about the world and how it can be a better place to live in.
